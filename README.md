This repo is all about Binary trees and different functions one can perform on such data structure.
and there will be 2 parts the first from file starting with 0 to 18 will be not so complicated then from there things will get ugly(just kidding but they will get tougher though). 

File: 0-binary_tree_node.c 
___________________________
is about: creation of a node


File: 1-binary_tree_insert_left.c
________________________________
is about: insert a left node child.


File:2-binary_tree_insert_right.c
________________________________
is about: insert right child node.


File: 3-binary_tree_delete.c
________________________________
is about: deletes entire binary tree.


File: 4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c
________________________________
is about: check if node is leaf.


File: 5-binary_tree_is_root.c
________________________________
is about: check if node is root.
